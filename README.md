### Reference Documentation

The solution I established is through a cycle to find the nth term of the Fibonacci series. 
It is a Rest API of type Http GET

A more efficient solution would be through mathematical induction or some heuristic related to the case. 
An attempt was made to solve it using the Binet formula, but it does not work for all cases.
